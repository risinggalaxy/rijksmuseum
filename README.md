ATTENTION: YOU SHOULD GET YOUR OWN RIJKSMUSEUM API-KEY FOR THIS PROJECT ðŸ”‘

For this iOS coding challenge, we would like to see a small iOS app fully authored by you. Keep this in mind, as we will equally look at how you approach versioning, as your code style consistency, naming, testing strategy, code layering, architecture, lifecycle gotchas, handling of failures, application of good programming practices etc. Requirements: â€¢ Use the Dutch Rijksmuseum API, see documentation here: https://data.rijksmuseum.nl/object-metadata/api/ â€¢ We would like the app to have at least two screens: o An overview page with a list of items (preferably a collection view) â–ª Itemsshouldhavetextandimage â–ª Pageshouldbepaginated o A detailpage, with more details about the item â€¢ Loading and converting JSON to objects should be asynchronous, a loading icon / animation should be shown â€¢ Automated tests should be present (full coverage not needed off course) â€¢ No SwiftUI, no Reactive, no storyboards â€¢ Architecture used â€¢ Tests written â€¢ Handling of failures (failed network calls, etc)
